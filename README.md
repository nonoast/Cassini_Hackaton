# Access the Copernicus Data Store (CDS) API
In order to access the CDS API, you first need to create an account on [CDS Portal](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu).

Then, on the [API Page](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api), you can Copy the two first lines of code, starting with `url:` and `key:`.\
You should add these two lines in a file name `.cdsapirc` in the directory ` $HOME/.cdsapirc`.

You can get further information on these 2 links:\
